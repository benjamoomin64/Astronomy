# Astronomy
It's an app that I use for my Astronomy Science Olympiad event.

I am extremely amateur and I'm trying my best to make something that can do the math I need it to do for my event. What exactly the event entails is a little bit of a learning curve so I can't provide a description of everything I need to be able to do.

# Contributing
I'm not asking for help contributing to this, I'm just using GitHub as a convenient place to store this in case I need to put it on someone else's computer. That being said, if you see some poor practice in my code somewhere do please let me know (preferably in a friendly way but I can handle criticism) because this is a learning experience for me and it'd be awesome to learn from more experienced coders. Thank you!
